Node Graph Software
===================

* This project has node graph related software and apps. 
* The goal of this project is to allow end users to automate parts of their lives.
* End users can encode their logic and tasks into node graphs, which will automatically run at approriate times. 
* Since most online tasks are performed in the browser, most of these nodes will automate the browser.
* However we will intend to have nodes which can communicate directly with web apis. (like google or facebook apis)
* We also intend to have nodes which can communicate with smart devices like amazon echo dot, nest cams, smart lights, smart locks, etc.
