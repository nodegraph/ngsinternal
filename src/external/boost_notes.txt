These headers were extract from boost 1.59.0, using its "bcp" tool.
None of the headers have been modified.

-- build b2 in the root boost directory
./bootstrap.sh

-- do the following to build bcp
cd tools/bcp
../../b2

-- now do the following to extract header files that we need
cd ../..
