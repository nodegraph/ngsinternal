These headers were extract from boost 1.59.0, using its "bcp" tool.
None of the headers have been modified.

-- build b2 in the root boost directory
./bootstrap.sh

-- do the following to build bcp
cd tools/bcp
../../b2

-- now do the following to extract header files that we need
cd ../..
./dist/bin/bcp boost/lexical_cast.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/math/constants/constants.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/math/special_functions/round.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/type_index.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/any.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/variant/variant.hpp ../local/boost_headers
./dist/bin/bcp boost/functional/hash.hpp ../local/boost_headers

-- on windows you'll need to switch the forward slash to back slashes.
.\dist\bin\bcp boost\lexical_cast.hpp ..\local\boost_headers

-- then copy the files from ../local/boost_headers into the nodegraphsoftware/src/external area.
