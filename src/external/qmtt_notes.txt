The upstream git repo is: https://github.com/emqtt/qmqtt.git

I took the files in the src dir and copied them here.
Some files were left out like .pro, .pri and qmqtt_global.h.

qmqtt_global.h is actually their export header file.
We make our own qmatt_global.h through cmake's export header system.
See the CMakeLists.txt file for details.
