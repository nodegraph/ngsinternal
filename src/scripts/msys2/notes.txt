In your msys2 .bashrc file, simply source the setup_env.sh script in this directory.
This script will read the $ARCH env variable to bring up an appropriate environment.

You will like want to create a desktop shortcuts similar to the following:

%comspec% /k ""%SRC_ROOT%\ngsinternal\src\scripts\msys2\launch_msys2.bat" ARCH_WINDOWS"
%comspec% /k ""%SRC_ROOT%\ngsinternal\src\scripts\msys2\launch_msys2.bat" ARCH_WINRT"
%comspec% /k ""%SRC_ROOT%\ngsinternal\src\scripts\msys2\launch_msys2.bat" ARCH_ANDROID"

Note that these shortcuts are setting the $ARCH env variable for setup_env.sh to read.

In the msys2 install, especially after updating with pacman, you'll need to uncomment the
following from the installed msys2_shell.bat file. Otherwise the msys2 shell won't pick
up the visual studio environment variable making cmake-gui harder to use.

rem To export full current PATH from environment into MSYS2 uncomment next line
*rem* set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit
