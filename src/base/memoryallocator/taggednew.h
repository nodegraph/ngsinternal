/*
 TRACK_NEW -- calls the constructor after allocating memory with our overloaded
 "new" operator which tracks allocations.

 TRACK_ALLOC -- only allocates memory.  Use it in situations where you would typically
 just use malloc. Internally however it just uses the overloaded "new" operator, to track
 memory so it can just be deleted like other allocations.

 TRACK_DELETE -- calls our overriden destroy operator after calling the destructor on the pointer.

 TRACK_DELETE_ARRAY -- similar to the above but for arrays.

 Note: -- that all destroys go thru our overriden destroy operators.
 -- but there are different overriden and overloaded news.
