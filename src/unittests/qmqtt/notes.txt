To run this text you'll need to set up an MQTT broker.
We use mosquitto.

Follow published web instruction on how to install mosquitto.
Note that only the 1_0_2 version of OpenSSL has the libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll files.
In more recent versions they may have been renamed and so won't work.

Now since we're on windows, we found that we cannot use the msys2 shell to run the mosquitto username/password commands properly.
So we'll use the windows command shell.

-- Create a password file:
mosquitto_passwd.exe -c D:\installs\srcdeps\publishing\mosquitto_config\passwords tester

-- The above line will prompt you for a password. Enter it.

-- Now copy the mosquitto.conf file from the windows install location (program files (x86)), to D:\installs\srcdeps\publishing\mosquitto_config.
-- Modify if as follows:
allow_anonymous false
password_file D:\installs\srcdeps\publishing\mosquitto_config\passwords 


-- Now run mosquitto as:
mosquitto -c D:\installs\srcdeps\publishing\mosquitto_config\mosquitto.conf

-- If you don't want to enable the username/password authentication then you can just mosquitto from the msys2 shell.
   The path has been modified in the msys2 setup scripts to find mosquitto.
