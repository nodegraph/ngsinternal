Features to add:

0) We need a marquee to select a bunch of nodes.
   Currently we need to ctrl each one which gets tedious.

1)
- allow nodes to display the same name in a group
- for example if you have a calculator app it would nice to show the
  number value as the text on the node

2)
- the inputs to nodes currently need to be linked in order to evaluate 
  some of kind of computed expression like value
- what if allowed inputs to have expressions also
- this would allow us to take values from the "in" input stream on the node
- this would alleviate a lot of extra wires which are currently used
  to embed properties into the data stream with the Embed node upstream and then extract
  properteis from the data stream with the Extract node downstream.


Todo:

- rename downloads_mode and downloads_page to downloading_...

- there is bug with getting image urls in ElemWrap.get_image() for images specified in style.content with  something like 
  webkit-set-image
- due to mouse hover the retrieved image url is different from other similar images on the page
- this happens for the inactive star icon, due to the hover some other state's star icon is retrieved in BrowserRecorder 
  from the crosshair. 

- when creating new nodes they should connect to one of the selected nodes
- this currently works properly for browser nodes but is not implemented for other node types

- there is a bug when copy and pasting nodes where existing links disappear

- when renaming nodes, the gui starts out with "new_name" as the name
- instead it should start with the current name of the node


Resolved Issues:

- on macos it seems like the .dmg for installer is sometimes not created
- this has been verified to happen when running the build script for both the debug and release at the same time
- it seems to be related to a lack of memory
- running each build separately seems to fix the issue


Bugs:

- currently you can add an MQTT publish or subscribe node without being inside an MQTT group
- this causes a crash. So we need to make sure nodes can only be added inside of their required context group

low priority features.
- qml enter data and edit data pages should automatically focus on the first input element
- also pressing the enter key should accpet the enter data or edit data page
- also some of the text entry entry fields look too wide ... example for entering numbers

Quality Check:
- build a graph which tests all nodes
- make sure all nodes return something thru their out plug if they have one
